## Basic/beginner things

- loops (so not every track has to explain over and over again what the 3 parts in a header are in general, which common types are there etc)
- standard types of conditionals ?
- "early return"
- something about package/modules/namespaces, why have them, why boundaries are important etc
- something general about arrays and typical operations on them?

## Less beginner things

- integers/unsigned integers (how are they represented, overflows etc)
- floating point numbers
- boolean logic, lazy evaluation
- unicode and UTF-8
- modulo operator (and variants)
- lexicographic order (I was not able to find a good article on this to link to from the comparison concept)
- variadic functions
- random number generation
- memory/addresses/pointers
- regex (what is it, what is it good for, common operators etc)
- OOP, classes, inheritance
- closures
- higher order functions, callbacks
- (hash) maps
- sets
- sync vs async code, concurrency/parallelism, multi-threading
- recursion
